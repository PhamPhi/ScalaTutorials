objects. In real world we have apdapters for power supplies,
adapter for camera memory cards, and so on. Probably everyone have seen some adapters for memory cards. If you can not plug in the camera memory in
your laptop you can use and adapter. You plug the camera memory in the adapter in to laptop slot. That's it, it's really simple.

What about software development? It's the same. Can you image an situation when you have some class expecting some type of object
